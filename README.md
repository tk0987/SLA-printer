look at the only folder inside this repo. theres everything.


I've tried to make this printer using Raspberry Pi Zero and small 7" lcd with touch. Everything was working just ok - but... I used DRV8825 for my stepper control. I didnt know, that stepper is 3 A rated, so short fried both raspberry and LCD to death.

So, i made working old-laptop version. Software is in dir.

What is important:

# I use nylon foil for screen-resin separation. Works brilliant, and is cheap.

I bought it in lidl for 4$, circa (in my country there are not $, so - circa).

Nylon is good - resin wont stick to it (look at the chemical structures of both).

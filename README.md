# SLA-3D-printer
raspberry pi zero W based SLA printer

currently only basic html gui is added.

yes, html gui. this SLA printer wont use other gui than this web one. It will be fully-wifi based, compatible with every web browser, including mobile.

as an UV screen i'll use 7 inch LCD screen without back (a'la mono!), 1024x600 px, which gives ~160 microns/pixel. Its HDMI screen, it works just fine with raspberry pi zero.

3, 2, 1... start

basic motor and gui connection added. next:
1. refine motor control code -done
2. drive lcd for printing - done
3. check it all and refine if needed - in progress. It will (probably) be ready tommorow.
